## Global Appearance

Since header and footer are in section groups, they:
- ✅ Appear on all pages automatically
- ✅ Can be configured once and apply everywhere
- ✅ Are managed in the theme customizer
- ✅ Don't need to be added to individual templates

- **Mobile Friendly**: Header and footer are responsive and work on all devices
