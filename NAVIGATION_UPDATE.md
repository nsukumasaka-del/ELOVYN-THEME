# Navigation Bar Update

The navigation bar has been updated to automatically include:

## Default Navigation Items

1. **Clothing** - Links to `#clothing` section
2. **Hair Products** - Links to `#bikes` section  
3. **Accessories** - Links to `#features` section

These three items are now **hardcoded** in the header and will always appear in both desktop and mobile navigation.

## How It Works

- **Desktop Navigation**: The three items appear first, followed by any additional menu items you configure
- **Mobile Navigation**: The three items appear in the mobile menu, followed by any additional menu items

## Additional Menu Items

You can still add additional navigation items through the theme customizer:

1. Go to **Online Store > Themes > Customize**
2. Click on the **Header** section
3. Under "Additional Menu Items (optional)", select a menu
4. Any links in that menu will appear after the three default items

## Section IDs

The navigation links point to these section IDs:
- `#clothing` - Clothing Showcase section
- `#bikes` - Hair Products Showcase section
- `#features` - Accessories Showcase section

## Smooth Scrolling

Smooth scrolling has been enabled for all anchor links, so clicking navigation items will smoothly scroll to the sections.

## No Setup Required

Unlike before, you **don't need to create a menu** for these three items - they're automatically included. You only need to create a menu if you want to add additional navigation items beyond Clothing, Hair Products, and Accessories.
